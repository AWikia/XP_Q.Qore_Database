# XP_Q.Qore_Database
Contains the Scripts (Both combined into one file and uncombined) and PBS files for external contributions - Based on Essentials 16.2

It also contains the RGSS Level font, a condensed variant of Level sans the non-BMP glyphs

When XP Q.Qore is being under development, this repo must be open so as to port out the changes (Especially for the scripts)

This work is done separately from Pokémon Essentials and is not tied to a specific Qora Qore Channel

This Reposistory cannot, however give any download links for XP Q.Qore for obvious reasons (The current Stable Release is the 25H1 ones based on Ι3Λ)

Currently based upon build 11952.109
